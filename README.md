# Modular Recommender Systems Pipelines

## Project Overview

`recsys-pipeline` is a modular recommender system pipeline designed to align with the four-stage recommender system architecture, ensuring efficient and scalable item retrieval.

This project focuses on:

- Experimenting with building recommender systems using different model designs, such as the two-tower model design.

- Constructing end-to-end pipelines that enable deployment of the entire system using MLOps best practices by leveraging the Feature/Training/Inference (FTI) architecture.
